    "\n",
    "Through our ‘Chocolate Bar Rating’ csv, which compiled a comprehensive review of nearly 2,500 dark chocolate bars, we were able to understand and address questions regarding factors that influence dark chocolate decisions. This information provides a basis for our analysis and allows consumers to narrow down the types of dark chocolate to choose from, which ultimately will help them make informed purchases. From this, the machine learning programs implemented, specifically the decision tree classifier and random forest regressor, help predict the rating of dark chocolate; our feature importance graph helps see which features are most important.

    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to most machine learning algorithms, our algorithms are subject to bias from confounding variables, such as missing data, non-random samples, and general human bias when it comes to dark chocolate reviews and ratings. We suggest that any consumers that utilize our classifier and/or regressor take the results with a grain of salt as it is not 100% accurate and taste can be very subjective. \n"

    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this project was motivated by the many studies that conclude dark chocolate has many health benefits. It is a great snack for people who crave something sweet but not all the calories and detrimental effects that come along with dessert. However, not all types and brands are created equal. It is difficult for consumers to choose between the many options that are available in the market today, all around the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The impact of this project is that it will provide insight into how different characteristics of a chocolate bar affect the final product and its quality. Understanding these influences will allow consumers to look for certain qualities in chocolate that they value, such as the origin of the beans or the ingredients used. Machine learning will be used to predict the ratings of chocolate bars based on quantitative characteristics of thousands of dark chocolate bars provided in the data set described below.**\n"

    "The first of two machine learning methods we decided to use was a Decision Tree Classifier. An explanation of what a Decision Tree Classifier is and its use can be found here. Since the goal of our project was to predict the quality of a chocolate, which was put into categorical buckets, based on its characteristics, it was determined this method was appropriate based on our desired results. We used the processed data set with the manufacturer, bean_origin, company_location, review columns converted to dummy variables to predict which rating bucket an unknown chocolate would fall into as a measure of quality. The reason a classifier was chosen over a regressor was due to the insignificance of a specific rating versus a range for a consumer who may use the model. In a practical example, a consumer would not care if a chocolate had a rating of exactly 3.86 to determine if a chocolate is good. It would be more impactful to separate the ratings into buckets to classify a grouping of chocolates ranging from terrible to delicious. \n",
    "    \n",
    "One assumption of this method that is being made is that a max_depth of 5 is a reasonable value to build the model. There is a possibility that a greater depth may be more accurate or effective, but for the purpose of this project, five was chosen for greatest visual impact while maintaining simplicity. Additionally, there is a level of bias and subjectivity through the use of this model. The intervals and number of buckets chosen were arbitrarily made based on what was thought to be reasonable, but smaller or larger ranges could potentially result in a better model if further analyzed. Another aspect of subjectivity is that it is unknown from where the ratings come from. It could be possible that if from a different source or a larger sample, the model could change as well."

    "The second of the two machine learning methods we decided to use was a Random Forest Regressor. An explanation of what a Random Forest Regressor is and its use can be found here. Since the goal of our project was to predict the quality of a chocolate based on its characteristics, it was determined this method was appropriate based on our desired results. We used the processed data set with the manufacturer, bean_origin, company_location, review columns converted to dummy variables to predict what the rating of  an unknown chocolate would be. We chose a random forest regressor model because we wanted to predict chocolate ratings, which is continuous data, based on their characteristics and columns mentioned above. Our machine learning involves taking these features and predicting the final rating.\n"

At each branching point, the decision determines which rating bucket would be most likely at that level. The most common features in the decision tree are if a word is present or not in its review column, but there are also other features from bean_origin and manufacturer throughout the tree. At the ends of the branches, it is predicted which rating bucket a chocolate would most likely be after following a path from the top."

    "After plotting our Random Forest Regression we wanted to see what were the key factors that helped predict our final chocolate rating and we plotted the top 10 values and interestingly some reviews helped determine the rating of a chocolate more and cocoa percentage was the biggest factor in predicting chocolate ratings."

    "Our initial problem statement targeted individuals who may have a difficult time choosing between the various available dark chocolate options. We approached this by implementing two different kinds of machine learning methods: the decision tree classifier and random forest regressor. Both of these are models designed to predict the rating of a certain kind of dark chocolate, which would help individuals in gauging the quality of the dark chocolate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision tree classifer and the feature importance graph were both tools used to direct individuals in finding good dark chocolate. The graph produced specifically shows that cocoa percent is an attribute to look for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because individuals will be relying on these models to inform their dark chocolate decisions, it’s imperative to identify any possible flaws that can be fixed in a further rendition of this project. The Random Forest Regressor only had an R2 score of 32.4%, which is on the lower end. The high amount of features also made it difficult to predict the dark chocolate ratings, which led to the Gini scores in the Decision Tree Classifier to be higher than we would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key aspect is the ratings, which can be very subjective. In this case, we don’t exactly know where or how these ratings were determined, i.e. with what standards or expectations. Additionally, the ratings also come from a single source. It would be interesting to see how these models are impacted with an entirely different set of ratings or even multiple ratings per dark chocolate type. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our model is a step in the right direction for better dark chocolate decisions, which can be furthered with more detailed data and more intricate analysis. "
